## Useful stuff

1. Queue is used to create a tree.
2 . Time complexity of binary tree travesal is o(n).
3. A stack is used to convert recursion


4. Post order interative travesal need to push addresses twice. the first address is move to the right. the second address will be used for printing. In order to differentiate the address used for printing, you store negative addreses.

6. Using a queu to traverce lever order;

7. Counting Nodes 
 - Counting full nodes with two children
 - Computing sum of all the nodes  return x+y+p.data;


7. The memory representation of a graph will affecte the time complexity. Example of memory representation.

   - Adjacency Matrix
   - Adjacency List (using an array of linked list) - out degree.
   - Inverse Adjacency list - in degree
   - Compact List

8. depth first search uses a stack.
9. breath first search uses a queue.
