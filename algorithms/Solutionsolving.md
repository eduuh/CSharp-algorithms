## What is algorthm

An algorithh is a series of defined instrcutions that perform a task.

We can break down the process of creating a sandwitch to an algorithm.

1. Retrieve the ingredients.
2. Slice the bread.
3. Spread mayo or mustard on the bread.
4. Place ham and cheese on the bread.
5. Combine pieces of bread.

When giving instruction to a computer, every step must be defined.
Almost every code instrcut you write is part of an algorithm.

- To make an aglorth more efficient, you often have to make assumptions about your data.
You might assume you data is sorted or it would only contnain intergers.

- The assumptions must be true in order to receive the expected output from an algorithm.

- A slow working algorthm is prefferend to a a fast algrithm that sometime does't work.
